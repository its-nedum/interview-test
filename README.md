Question 1

JavaScript:
Create the function chinedusConstant(num) that would take the num parameter being passed which will be a 4-digit number with at least two distinct digits. 
Your program should perform the following routine on the number: 
Arrange the digits in descending order and in ascending order (adding zeroes to fit it to a 4-digit number), and subtract the smaller number from the bigger number. Then repeat the previous step. Performing this routine will always cause you to reach a fixed number: 6174. Then performing the routine on 6174 will always give you 6174 (7641 - 1467 = 6174). Your program should return the number of times this routine must be performed until 6174 is reached. For example: if num is 3524 your program should return 3 because of the following steps: (1) 5432 - 2345 = 3087, (2) 8730 - 0378 = 8352, (3) 8532 - 2358 = 6174.


Question 2

SQL:
Let N be the number of CITY entries in STATION, and let N' be the number of distinct CITY names in STATION; query the value of N - N' from STATION. In other words, find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.

```
STATION Table:
Field      Type
ID         INT
CITY       VARCHAR(21)
STATE      VARCHAR(21)
```
